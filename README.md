# Eclipse Hub Website 🌑✨

Welcome to the **Eclipse Hub Website**!  

Right now, the site itself is **basically finished** ✅ — design, features, and all the goodies are here.  
The only thing holding it back is **hosting**. I’m still testing and making sure it can run **smoothly without issues** before pushing it live for everyone.  

---

## ⚠️ Current Status
- Website build: **DONE**
- Hosting setup: **In progress**
- Public launch: **Coming soon!**

---

## 🚀 What's Next
- Find a hosting solution that doesn’t break anything
- Make sure performance + stability are 🔥
- Then… finally launch!

---

## 💡 Note
This repo is public for transparency, but the live version isn’t available **yet**.  
Stay tuned — once I solve the hosting puzzle, the Eclipse Hub Website will be online and ready! 🎉
